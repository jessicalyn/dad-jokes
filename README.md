# DadJokes

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 12.0.5.

## Overview:

This is an app which displays Dad Jokes from the [icanhazdadjoke.com](icanhazdadjoke.com) API. The user can click the button to retrieve new jokes to be added to the page.

## Getting Started:

These instructions will get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for usage and testing purposes.

Clone the repo: ``` git clone https://github.com/jessicalyn/dad-jokes.git```

cd into directory and run npm install: ``` npm install```

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. 

Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Known Bugs/Things to Fix:
- Highlight or predominantly display current joke to be retrieved. It gets lost in the grouping. 
- Definitely need to add testing.
- Improve styling :)

## Future Development and Extensions Notes:
- Save jokes array to NgRx state management.
- Deploy to Heroku, etc so users do not need to pull down repo to use the app.
